# Telsa-vs-GameStop
For this project, we will assume the role of a Data Analyst working for a new startup investment firm that helps customers invest their money in stocks. My job is to extract financial data like historical share price and quarterly revenue reportings from various sources using Python libraries and webscraping on popular stocks. After collecting this data we will visualize it in a dashboard to identify patterns or trends. The stocks we will work with are Tesla and GameStop.
A dashboard often provides a view of key performance indicators in a clear way. Analyzing a data set and extracting key performance indicators will be practiced. Prompts will be used to support learning in accessing and displaying data in dashboards.
